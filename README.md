# 👋 About Me

I’m Hamid Ghasemi, a Principal Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a strong foundation in mathematical modeling and statistical inference. I specialize in building scalable machine learning systems, with hands-on experience deploying end-to-end inference pipelines on AWS using Step Functions, Lambda, and other serverless tools.

My work spans applied machine learning, automation, cloud architecture, and mentoring teams on ML best practices and production-ready design. I enjoy working at the intersection of research and engineering, translating insights into real-world impact.
